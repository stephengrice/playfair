# Description

This project was completed as a homework assignment for Cryptography & Data Security, a course at Stockton University taught by Dr. Vincent Cicirello.

It provides a terminal interface, supporting encryption and decryption of messages using the Playfair cipher, as well as the ability to display the Playfair matrix for a given key.
